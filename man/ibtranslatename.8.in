.TH IBTRANSLATENAME 8 "September 12, 2011" "Pragmatic Infiniband Utilities" "Infiniband Diagnostics"

.SH NAME
ibtranslatename \- Translate from IB name to cononical cluster name

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ibtranslatename [-hf] [-s <char>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Open Fabrics InfiniBand software stack forms the node description name from
the hostname and HCA number.  The general form is "<hostname> HCA-X"  Where X
is the number of the HCA in the system.  This is incompatible with most of the
tools used in the CHAOS/TOSS operating system which expects a conoical name
consisting of just the hostname.  In order to cross reference other tools with
the InfiniBand tools ibtranslatename can read a config file and translate the
"IB" name to cononical name and vice versa.

The default behavior is to translate from cononical name to IB name.
Furthermore, in the absence of a configuration for a particular node the
default mapping is cononical name "<cluster_name>Y" translates to IB name
"<cluster_name>Y HCA-1".  Where Y is the node number.
